## Machine Learning and Physics, Sheet 3 

### Setup
Use the same conda environment as for Sheet 1.

Pull from this repo to get the new exercise sheet and navigate into it:
```bash
git pull
```

Or alternatively, download it as zip.

Activate the conda environment from sheet 1:
```bash
conda activate mlph
```
Then you can start jupyter (run `jupyter notebook`) and open sheet03.ipynb, 
which you should use as the basis for the solution of the practical excercises.


### Hand in
 Hand in both your jupyter notebook, and an exported pdf (File -> Save and Export Notebook As -> PDF). 
 If you encounter problems exporting the pdf like this, please print your notebook to pdf and hand this in.
